# The site I have created for this HW is a list of the top four cats from a fictional event called "Cat Competition", where cats are judged for arbitrary reasons and then ranked. There is also a list of cats to look out for in the next competition contained in a table. I picked this idea because it seemed silly and fun, and I'm also a big cat enthusiast. I used all the HTML elements specified in the HW document: correct document structure, metadata, text elements, multiple pictures, working hyperlinks, a table with 3 columns and 4 rows, 5 <div> elements, CSS styling that affected multiple elements, and a feature we didn't discuss in class in the form of a progress bar.
