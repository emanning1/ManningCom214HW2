            <p>Moe is the winner of our twenty-third annual Cat Competition! He put up a great show this year, a really stunning performance that blew the judge's expectations out of the water. Congratulations Moe!!</p>

            <p>Our second place spot goes to Gremlin! This cat simply has no parallel when it comes to silliness, but unfortunatly she could not keep up with Moe's raw talent. Still put up a heck of a performance, congratulations Gremlin!</p>

            <h3>Third Place</h3>
            <img src="images/PennyCat.png" >
            <p>Rounding out the top three is Penny! Penny is new to the world of Cat Competition so she has that un-killable rookie spirit! Once this cat gets some more game time under her belt, you can expect her to place higher. Good work Penny! </p>

            <h4>Fourth Place</h4>
            <img src="images/FreyaCat.png" >
            <p>Freya's performance this year was unfortunatley not enough to get her into the top three, but it was damn good enough for top four! This cat had a tough preperation period before the Competition, so its not all her fault for not winning it again. Regardless, she did a great job and beat a lot of other cats! </p>
